    "1. Normality of sampling distribution : It means the distribution of sample mean is normally distributed.\n",

    "4. Random sampling: The data should be collected using random sampling methods to ensure that the sample is\n",
    "representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of violations and their impacts:\n",
    "1. Non-normality: If the data is not normally distributed, the F-statistic from ANOVA may not be accurate. This\n",

    "2. Non-independence: If the data points are not independent, the F-statistic from ANOVA may not be accurate. This\n",
    "could lead to an incorrect conclusion about the significance of the results.\n",
    "3. Heteroscedasticity: When the assumption of homogeneity of variance is violated, meaning that the variances differ\n",

    "group differences.\n",
    "4. Small sample sizes: If the sample sizes are too small, the F-statistic from ANOVA may not be accurate. This could\n",
